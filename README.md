# Trivia Game

This is a Star Wars themed multiple choice trivia game. There is a timer that will end the game as it expires. Or if the player misses three questions the game will also end.

This game was programmed using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No frameworks or libraries were used.

My approach was more focused on the Javascript and having a functional game. I tried to keep my functions bite sized and easy to alter. I also attempted to style the game dynamically. That turned out okay.

I used the website Thought Catalog for most of the trivia questions. Also I got the Darth Vader background image from the website Polygon.
